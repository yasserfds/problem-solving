Problem: Palindrome Checker

Write a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. 

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads 
the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Your function should return True if the input is a palindrome and False otherwise.
